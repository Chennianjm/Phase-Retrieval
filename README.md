# Phase-Retrieval
##DPAC
    The DPAC algorithm is used to achieve a given target intensity and obtain a computed hologram,
that is, phase recovery, to achieve the use of hologram to recover the target image.

##GS
     Using the angular spectrum diffraction theory, the GS algorithm is used to achieve a given target
intensity and obtain a computed hologram, that is, phase recovery, to achieve the recovery of the 
target image with the hologram.
